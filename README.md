A simple on click event of spark

On Click Spark is a lightweight JavaScript project that creates a spark animation effect wherever the user clicks on the screen. It utilizes Web Components to generate SVG-based animated sparks with customizable colors. Users can pick a color for the spark effect using a color input. The animation triggers on clicks, enhancing user interactions with a visually appealing touch.
